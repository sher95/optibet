###Web ui Optibet automation On windows 
Should be installed Python 3.10

1. Clone repository to your IDE

2. Create vertual environment and activate it:  source venv/bin/activate

3. pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Before to run should login for that just modify email and password in test.py file. Put there your own login data

5. To run test in the terminal, run this command: pytest -v -s from Project directory

Opinion of view:
I tryed to test with POM pattern but time complexity was very high: 1m 10sec
Then I decided to use just structured pattern which is understandable for automator(regardless of the level)
